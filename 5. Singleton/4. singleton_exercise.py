Singleton Coding Exercise
Since implementing a singleton is easy, you have a different challenge: write a function called is_singleton() . This method takes a factory method that returns an object and it's up to you to determine whether or not that object is a singleton instance.

    # depending on whether the factory makes a
    # singleton or not
